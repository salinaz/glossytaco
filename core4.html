  <h3>Loops:</h3>
  <p title = "loop defn">
  A coding structure that is used to repeat certain parts of the code multiple times (can be a fixed quantity or infinite).
  A loop with a fixed number of repeats is known as a "for loop" and a loop that repeats infinitely is called a "while loop".
  Think of a loop as a music conductor that keeps saying "do it again, straight from the top!" until they're satisfied with the repetition.
