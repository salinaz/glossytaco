    <h3>Loops:</h3>
    <p title = "loop defn">
    A coding structure that is used to repeat certain parts of the code multiple times (can be a fixed quantity or infinite).
    A loop with a fixed number of repeats is known as a "for loop" and a loop that repeats infinitely is called a "while loop".
    Think of a loop as a music conductor that keeps saying "do it again, straight from the top!" until they're satisfied with the repetition.

    <h3>Variables:</h3>
    <p title = "variable defn">
      A "named place" to store information values in different forms, which can be changed under certain conditions.
      It's essentially equivalent to a variable in algebra.
    </p>

    <h3>Conditionals:</h3>
  <p title = "cond defn">
      The "what if" parts of the coding that cause the program to react in certain ways when set conditions are met.
      They follow a format of "if (condition)... else if/elif (condition)... else (condition)...".
      Conditionals are the fine print of a code's contract, which creates stipulations and technicalities under various circumstances.

    <h3>Functions:</h3>
  <p title = "function defn">
    The "shortcut" used to run designated parts of codes multiple times and can also use different variables and parameters each time.
    They follow a format of "def functionname(variable)... what the function does... functionname(diffvariable)".
    Functions are like neverending callbacks, where the same person is asked to perform similar tasks again.
